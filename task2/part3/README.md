How to interpret task 3 image:

At first lights 1 and 2 (L1 & L2) are green so the traffic goes both ways on the main road for 10 cars. After 10 cars have passed L1 and L2 turn red and at the same time lights 3 and 4 (L3 & L4) turn green. Both lights are green until 5 cars have passed after which they turn red. Finally light 5 (L5) turns green and 5 cars go through to the main road. This main cycle then repeats indefinitely.

The image below is an illustration of lights and their numbers.
